reate a java program that performs the following operation:
The program should collect an integer array from the user
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items
Find the Mean Value
Find the Median Value
Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.


steps 

->first create a user defined function by th name mean and then write the mean code insthat int that function
->after the mean function create another user defined function by the variable name median and write all the median required code in it 
->same as the above two create a user defined function for the mode operation and implement the code in it 

->after createing 3 different user denined function other than the main function noe create the main function and call a switch case in it so that you can select a option to get a answer in mean,median or mode
