->In this lab we have text file .  we have to upload the file in to our code .
->From that file firstly we have to check vowles and their count. Here we have to check the vowels (i.e., a,e,i,o,u) from the text file  that we uploaded .That it will show it as
The total vowel counts are: 
a:357
e:504
i:360
o:260
u:107
->Next we have to count digits and their count> Here we have to check the digits(i.e., 0,1,2,3,.............) from th etext file that we uploaded.We will get output like this
The total digit counts are:
0:6
1:6
2:7
3:4
4:2
5:4
6:2
7:4
8:2
9:0
-> From the hole file that we updated we have check the top 5 repeated words and their count like how many times that have be repeated
The Top Five repeated words and their count:
and 34
of 32
the 25
to 25
energy 12
-> Least five repeated characters and their count. That means word that are least repeated .
The Least Five repeated characters and their count: 
8 3
6 3
z 3
4 3
j 3
->Top 5 repeated characters and their counts.the characters that are most repeated characters
The Top Five repeated characters and their count:
e 505
i 361
a 358
t 338
n 335
